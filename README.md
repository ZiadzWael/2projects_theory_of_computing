# Theory of Computing Projects: NFA & CFG Implementations

Two Python implementations exploring formal language theory concepts - converting regular expressions to NFAs and parsing context-free grammars.

## 📋 Overview

### Project 1: Regex to NFA Converter
Python-based regex to NFA converter using Thompson's construction. Features Shunting Yard parsing, ε-transition handling, and Graphviz visualization. Outputs transition tables and automata diagrams for regular expressions.

### Project 2: CFG Parser & Parse Tree Generator
CFG parser with recursive descent parsing and visual parse trees. Supports ε-productions, custom grammar rules via interactive input, and Graphviz tree generation for string validation against context-free grammars.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install graphviz
# Also install Graphviz system package:
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install graphviz
# macOS: brew install graphviz
# Windows: Download from graphviz.org
